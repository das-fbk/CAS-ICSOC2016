# Abstract
Modern service-basedsystems are progressively becoming more heterogeneous. They form a socio-technical system, composed of distributed entities, software and human participants, interacting with and within the environment. These systems operate under constant perturbations that are due to unexpected changes in the environment and to the unpredictable behavior of the participants. We argue that for a service-based system to be resilient, adaptation must be collective. Multiple participants must adapt their behavior in concert to respond to critical runtime impediments. In this work, we present a framework for the modeling and execution of large-scale service-based Collective Adaptive Systems. Adaptation needs are solved in a decentralized and collective manner. To demonstrate the generality of the framework, we apply it to two application domains through which the main features are illustrated and evaluated: the Urban Mobility system and the Surveillance system.
