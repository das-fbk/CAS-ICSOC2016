# Abstract
Modern service-based systems are becoming more and more socio-technical, composed of distributed and heterogeneous entities, their environment, a mixture of people and software services. These systems operate under continuous perturbations due both to umpredicted behaviours of people and occurrence of exogenous changes in the environment. 
In these settings, for a service-based system to be resilient, adaptation must be collective, that is multiple entities must adapt simultaneously in a way that addresses critical runtime conditions whilst preserving the benefits of the collaborative inter-dependencies.

In this work, we present a framework for the development and operation of large-scale, service-based Collective Adaptive Systems, where adaptation needs are solved in a decentralized and collective fashion. To demonstrate the generality of the framework, we apply it in two different application domains, namely the Urban Mobility system and the Surveillance system, through which its main features are illustrated and evaluated.
